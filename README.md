# Professional README Generator

## Description

I built this app so that I could partially automate the task of creating README files for future projects. I purposely built it so I could omit sections and they would automatically not appear in body of the README and the Table of Contents. During the process I learned a lot about node.js, working without a browser, json, npm and Inquirer. Everything in this README except for the screen shot was made with this app.

## Table of Contents

- [Description](#description)

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

- [Questions](#questions)
- [License](#license)

## Usage

Type node index.js into the command line and then answer the prompts to create a README file with that information in it.
